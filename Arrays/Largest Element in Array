Brute force:- Sorting the array so the last element will be the largest one.
TC: O(nlogn)
SC: O(1)

Optimal:- we would initialize the largest variable  and store the first element in that variable and iterate in the array with a condition largets < arr[i], 
if this condition violates we would change the elements in the largest variable.
TC: O(n)
SC: O(1)




class Solution
{
public:
    int largest(vector<int> &arr, int n)
    {
        int largest = arr[0];
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(largest < arr[i])
            {
                largest = arr[i];
            }
        }
        return largest;
    }
};
